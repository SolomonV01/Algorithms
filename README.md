**Fisher-Yeats Shuffle:**
[https://github.com/SolomonV01/Algorithms](url)

The Fisher-Yeats shuffle is an algorithm that shuffles a finite array sequence (an int or a string).
For my assignment:
I created a simple int array that shuffles based on the algorithm mentioned above.


**Data Structures:**
